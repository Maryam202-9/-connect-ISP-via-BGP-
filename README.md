# Connect ISP via BGP

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and configuring an internal and external network using Cisco switches and routers, ultimately establishing communication between different routing protocols through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

## Project Goals
- Build an internal and external network using Cisco devices.
- Implement and configure dynamic routing protocols (OSPF and EIGRP).
- Establish communication between different protocols through BGP.
- Document the design and present the final network topology and configurations.

## Tasks
- Install internal and external networks using Cisco switches and routers.
- Use Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3 for network simulation.
- Design a topology containing 10 routers and 2 switches.
- Configure routers using OSPF protocol: stubby area, totally stubby area, and backbone area.
- Configure routers using EIGRP protocol.
- Establish communication between OSPF and EIGRP via BGP.
- Document the entire project, including network design, configurations, and protocol communication.
- Prepare and deliver the final presentation.

## Deliverables
- Network design diagram.
- Packet Tracer or GNS3 project file.
- Basic router configurations:  
  - Hostname  
  - Enable secret and VTY passwords (Cisco and CCNP)  
  - Welcome message  
  - Encrypt all passwords  
  - IP addresses for serial and FastEthernet ports  
- OSPF configuration:  
  - Stubby area  
  - Totally stubby area  
  - ASBR configuration  
- EIGRP AS 1 configuration.
- BGP configuration.
- Final report and presentation.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- GNS3
- Cisco Routers & Switches
- Routing Protocols: OSPF, EIGRP, BGP

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the Packet Tracer or GNS3 file.
3. Follow the configurations step-by-step as outlined in the documentation.
